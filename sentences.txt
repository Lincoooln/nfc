DEFINITELY
IT WILL REMAIN UNPREDICTABLE
ABSOLUTELY NOT
EXPLORE IT WITH PLAYFUL CURIOSITY
BE DELIGHTFULLY SURE OF IT
BETTER TO WAIT
IT SEEMS ASSURED
DO IT EARLY
KEEP IT TO YOURSELF
STARTLING EVENTS MAY OCCUR AS A RESULT
THE ANSWER MAY COME TO YOU IN ANOTHER LANGUAGE
YOU WILL NEED TO ACCOMMODATE
DOUBT IT
IT WILL BRING GOOD LUCK
BE PATIENT
YOU WILL FIND OUT EVERYTHING YOU’LL NEED TO KNOW
THERE IS A SUBSTANTIAL LINK TO ANOTHER SITUATION
WATCH AND SEE WHAT HAPPENS
IT WILL AFFECT HOW OTHERS SEE YOU
YOU’LL BE HAPPY YOU DID
GET IT IN WRITING
UNFAVORABLE AT THIS TIME
UPGRADE ANY WAY YOU CAN
IF YOU DO AS YOU’RE TOLD
IF IT’S DONE WELL; IF NOT, DON’T DO IT AT ALL
DON’T ASK FOR ANY MORE AT THIS TIME
AVOID THE FIRST SOLUTION
YOU’LL GET THE FINAL WORD
PROCEED AT A MORE RELAXED PACE
THE BEST SOLUTION MAY NOT BE THE OBVIOUS ONE

DEAL WITH IT LATER
FOLLOW SOMEONE ELSE’S LEAD

BET ON IT
FINISH SOMETHING ELSE FIRST
YOU MAY HAVE OPPOSITION
YOU ARE TOO CLOSE TO SEE
THE SITUATION IS UNCLEAR
A SUBSTANTIAL EFFORT WILL BE REQUIRED
ALLOW YOURSELF TO REST FIRST
THE CHANCE WILL NOT COME AGAIN SOON
RECONSIDER YOUR APPROACH
IT WOULD BE INADVISABLE
WAIT FOR A BETTER OFFER
SETTLE IT SOON

GET A CLEARER VIEW
TAKE A CHANCE
NOW YOU CAN
DON’T OVERDO IT
IT WILL SUSTAIN YOU
IT’LL COST YOU
IT IS SURE TO MAKE THINGS INTERESTING
BE PRACTICAL
SAVE YOUR ENERGY
IT IS CERTAIN
IT IS UNCERTAIN
THE OUTCOME WILL BE POSITIVE
NO MATTER WHAT
YOU MAY HAVE TO DROP OTHER THINGS
DON’T BE CONCERNED
PREPARE FOR THE UNEXPECTED
IT IS NOT SIGNIFICANT

WHATEVER YOU DO, THE RESULTS WILL BE LASTING
KEEP AN OPEN MIND
IT’S A GOOD TIME TO MAKE PLANS
IT MAY BE DIFFICULT BUT YOU WILL FIND VALUE IN IT
IT IS WORTH THE TROUBLE
THERE WILL BE OBSTACLES TO OVERCOME

IT’S NOT WORTH A STRUGGLE
DON’T FORGET TO HAVE FUN
DON’T DOUBT IT
A STRONG COMMITMENT WILL ACHIEVE GOOD RESULTS
TRY A MORE UNLIKELY SOLUTION
LEAVE BEHIND OLD SOLUTIONS
NOT IF YOU’RE ALONE
MISHAPS ARE HIGHLY PROBABLE
PRESS FOR CLOSURE
REALIZE THAT TOO MANY CHOICES IS AS DIFFICULT AS TOO FEW
LISTEN MORE CAREFULLY; THEN YOU WILL KNOW
THE ANSWER IS IN YOUR BACKYARD
LAUGH ABOUT IT
OTHERS WILL DEPEND ON YOUR CHOICES
LET IT GO
THAT WOULD BE A WASTE OF MONEY
GIVE IT ALL YOU’VE GOT
YOU DON’T REALLY CARE
YOU’LL NEED TO CONSIDER OTHER WAYS
A YEAR FROM NOW IT WON’T MATTER
DON’T WASTE YOUR TIME
IT COULD BE EXTRAORDINARY
COUNT TO TEN; ASK AGAIN
ACT AS THOUGH IT IS ALREADY REAL
SETTING PRIORITIES WILL BE A NECESSARY PART OF THE PROCESS
USE YOUR IMAGINATION
IT’S GONNA BE GREAT
TO ENSURE THE BEST DECISION, BE CALM
YOU’LL HAVE TO MAKE IT UP AS YOU GO
YOU’LL REGRET IT
UNQUESTIONABLY
OF COURSE
YOU KNOW BETTER NOW THAN EVER BEFORE
TRUST YOUR INTUITION
CONSIDER IT AN OPPORTUNITY
ASK YOUR FATHER
NEVER
ASK YOUR MOTHER
PERHAPS, WHEN YOU’RE OLDER
ONLY DO IT ONCE
MAYBE
NO
YES
